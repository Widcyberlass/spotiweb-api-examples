# Spotify Accounts Authentication Examples

This project contains basic demos showing the different OAuth 2.0 flows for [authenticating against the Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/authorization-guide/).

These examples cover:

* Authorization Code flow
* Client Credentials flow
* Implicit Grant flow

## Installation

These examples run on Node.js. On [its website](http://www.nodejs.org/download/) you can find instructions on how to install it. You can also follow [this gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) for a quick and easy way to install Node.js and npm.

Once installed, clone the repository and install its dependencies running:

    $ npm install

### Using your own credentials
You will need to register your app and get your own credentials from the Spotify for Developers Dashboard.

To do so, go to [your Spotify for Developers Dashboard](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and create your application. For the examples, we registered these Redirect URIs:

* http://localhost:8888 (needed for the implicit grant flow)
* http://localhost:8888/callback

Once you have created your app, set the following environment variables with the ones you get from My Applications in the Developers Dashboard.

```bash
# shell
export CLIENT_ID=YOUR_ID
export CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET
export REDIRECT_URI=YOUR_URI
```

OR

Set environment variables in a `.env` file in the `authorization_code` and `client_credentials` directories.

##### Example
```bash
# authorization_code/.env file

CLIENT_ID=YOUR_ID
CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET
REDIRECT_URI=YOUR_URI
```

## Running the examples
In order to run the different examples, open the folder with the name of the flow you want to try out, and run its `app.js` file. For instance, to run the Authorization Code example do:

    $ cd authorization_code
    $ node app.js

Then, open `http://localhost:8888` in a browser.
